      "message": "Well, as always, i\u0027m bit sceptical to copy/paste sources from core to plugins? In this case the situation is really ridiculous: This file is already contained in the plugin-api, or more precisely: class file. To be used in client side plugin you need the source and of course you need GWT modules. I think it was a bug that we havn\u0027t exposed extension client sources to plugin API. With this change you can remove this file [1].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63489",
