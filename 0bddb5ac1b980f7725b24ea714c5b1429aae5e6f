When I initially created this project I only wanted to eXtend the Gerrit DOCumentation by some FAQs written in Markdown, but now it is really about rendering project documentation. I only reused this project because I was too lazy to create a new one and didn\u0027t want to come up with a new name. I still kind of like \"xdocs\" but maybe there are also better proposals?",
